 * Make use of the three protected variables inherited from Attacker. These variables include:
 * protected ArrayList<Node> capturedNodes - a list of the already captured nodes
 * protected ArrayList<Node> availableNodes - a list of the available nodes for attacking and probing.
 * protected int budget - the current budget of the Attacker. Be careful that your next move will not cost more than your budget.
