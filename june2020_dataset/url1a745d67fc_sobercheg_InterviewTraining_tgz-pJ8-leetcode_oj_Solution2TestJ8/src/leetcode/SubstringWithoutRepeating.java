                The next question is to ask yourself what happens when you found a repeated character? For example,
                if the string is “abcdcedf”, what happens when you reach the second appearance of ‘c’?

When you have found a repeated character (let’s say at index j), it means that the current substring (excluding the
repeated character of course) is a potential maximum, so update the maximum if necessary. It also means that the
repeated character must have appeared before at an index i, where i is less than j.

Since you know that all substrings that start before or at index i would be less than your current maximum,
you can safely start to look for the next substring with head which starts exactly at index i+1.
