/**
 * This is a sample simulation running a very simple task we call the "Hello World" task. This
 * simulation is meant to demonstrate how the CLARION library can be setup. It uses mostly default
 * settings, so it should not be considered as being the definitive method for setting up a simulation
 * using the CLARION Library. It is, however, a good place to start for learning how to setup a 
 * simulation.
 * <p>
 * <u>Overview of the task:</u><br>
 * This task simulates the "Hello World" task. It uses a single agent who's job is to respond either 
 * "hello" or "goodbye" based on the salutation you give it and the salutation it has the goal to 
 * wants to give. The objective is for the agent to respond with the same salutation as the salutation it is 
 * given.
 * <p>
 * The agent has been setup using the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The Motivational Subsystem (MS) using the GENERIC personality and the drive strength equation 
 * (without the neural net). However, only the deficits for AFFILIATION_AND_BELONGINGNESS and 
 * AUTONOMY are specified.</li>
 * <li>The Meta Cognitive Subsystem (MCS) using the goal selecting module and the ACS level 
 * probability setting module (both using the equation, not a neural net).</li>
 * <li>The Action Centered Subsystem (ACS) with a neural network in the bottom level and RER 
 * turned on.<br>
 * The neural network uses simplified Q-learning with backpropagation and has been setup as follows:
 * </li>
 * <ul><li>Four inputs - </li>
 * <ul><li>Desired_Salutation: Hello (internally set by a goal)</li>
 * <li>Desired_Salutation: Goodbye (internally set by a goal)</li>
 * <li>Salutation: Hello (from the outside world)</li>
 * <li>Salutation: Goodbye (from the outside world)</li></ul>
 * <li>Two outputs -</li>
 * <ul><li>Hello</li>
 * <li>Goodbye</li></ul></ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In addition, there are also a few optional settings. These options are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Turning on the benefit equation (in initializeAgentInternalSpace)</li>
 * <li> Specifying a thresholds for generalization and specialization (in initializeCLARIONAgent)</li>
 * <li> Specifying the information gain measure to use (in initializeCLARIONAgent)</li>
 * <li> Adjusting the learning-rate and momentum parameters for the neural network in the ACS (in initializeCLARIONAgent)</li>
 * <li> Supplying a deficit change processor (updateDeficit method which is called in run).</li>
 * </ul>
 * If you would like to see how these optional settings affect the simulation, simply add/remove
 * comments in the initializeAgentInternalSpace and run methods to include/exclude those settings.
 * <p>
 * It is highly recommended that you explore the documentation to get a sense of where all
 * of the various parameters are located and what options you have for configuring the system. The 
 * documentation also provides a plethora of information on how to setup various pieces of the architecture.
 * If you are having difficulty figuring out how a part of the library works you can contact the 
 * CLARION library support team at:<br>
 * <a href="mailto:clarion.support@gmail.com">clarion.support@gmail.com</a>
 * <br>
 * It is advised that you check the documentation before contacting the support team as it may be
 * able to answer your question.
 * <p>
 * <b>Level of difficulty:</b>
 * <ul>Easy</ul>
