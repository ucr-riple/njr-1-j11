/** The EmailAddress class represents an email address. Here only a
  very limited variant is used that allows an address to be defined
  and verified. A typical usage example is:
  EmailAddress ea = new EmailAddress("john@company.com");
  boolean isProper = ea.isValid();

  Please note that the implementation of isValid is on purpose WRONG!

   * 13a@s.m.com (identifier starting with digit)

   * a.b.c (missing @)
   * abc@ (missing identifier after @)
   * @return true if the address obeys this format.
